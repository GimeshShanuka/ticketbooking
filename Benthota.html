                            Beautiful beaches and a variety of marine life may be found at Sri Lanka's Bentota.
                             The turtle hatchery is one of Bentota's major attractions. A turtle hatchery is a facility
                              for conservation that tries to safeguard sea turtles and encourage their survival.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                             Several kinds of sea turtles, including the Green turtle, Hawksbill turtle, Olive Ridley turtle, 
                             Loggerhead turtle, and Leatherback turtle, are present in the area. You may learn more about them
                              at a turtle hatchery in Bentota. The survival of these threatened species is greatly aided by these 
                              hatcheries.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                            Protecting turtle eggs and ensuring a greater survival rate for young turtles are the major goals of 
                            a turtle hatchery. Turtle eggs placed on the beach are often collected and moved as part of the procedure.

                        1 .The hatchery's staff or volunteers monitor the beaches where sea turtles lay their eggs and collect them.
                           By doing this, the eggs are protected from health risks, theft, and inadvertent harm.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                        2 .Due to their proximity to the high tide line or other possible threats, sea turtle nests can occasionally be in risk.
                           Whenever this happens, the hatchery team carefully moves the nests to a more secure area.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                        3 .The gathered sea turtle eggs are placed in suitably constructed artificial nests or incubation chambers.
                           The temperature and humidity are regulated to replicate natural circumstances so that the eggs can develop and hatch.    
                           <br>
                           <br>
                        4 .The hatchery staff sees to the correct upkeep and treatment of the eggs. This requires monitoring the incubation process,
                         protecting the eggs from predators, and providing perfect growing conditions.   
                         <br>
                         <br>
                        5 .The hatchling sea turtles are carefully released into the ocean after emerging from their eggs. The hatchery team makes sure 
                        that the release is done safely, reducing any dangers that might be present for the turtles.   
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        6 .There are many hatcheries with educational aspects in Bentota. They inform visitors and locals about the importance of sea turtle conservation,
                         the threats to their existence, and the best ways to protect this endangered species.
