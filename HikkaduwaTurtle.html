                            The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is a turtle conservation project located in the town of Hikkaduwa in Sri Lanka.
                            The hatchery was established in 1986 with the aim of protecting sea turtle eggs and raising hatchlings in a 
                            ]protected environment until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean.
                            The hatchery is run by a non-profit organization and is funded through donations and entrance fees.
                            Visitors can learn about the different species of sea turtles found in Sri Lanka, as well as the threats
                            they face from habitat destruction, poaching, and pollution.
