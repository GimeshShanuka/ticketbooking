                            Turtles are a type of reptile, specifically belonging to the order Testudines. Within this order, 
                            there are two suborders: Cryptodira and Pleurodira. The Cryptodira includes most turtle species, 
                            including sea turtles, box turtles, and snapping turtles. The Pleurodira suborder, on the other hand, 
                            includes side-necked turtles found in South America, Africa, and Australia.
                            Turtles are also often categorized based on their habitat. For example, there are aquatic turtles, 
                            such as sea turtles, pond turtles, and river turtles, as well as terrestrial turtles, such as tortoises. 
                            Additionally, some turtles are semi-aquatic, meaning they spend time both in water and on land.
